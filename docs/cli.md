# Trefoil's Command Line Interface

_Note: under active development. Expect new commands and options._

Use `--help` option on any command for more information about how to use that
command.

Nearly throughout, trefoil assumes that data have a 2 dimensional geospatial
component (y, x) and an optional temporal component.

```
> trefoil --help

Usage: trefoil [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Command line interface for trefoil

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

## Bin time series

_experimental, subject to change_

`bin_ts` will bin time series data by an interval, for example, to turn an
annual time series into a decadal time series.

```
> trefoil bin_ts --help

Usage: trefoil bin_ts [OPTIONS] FILES VARIABLE

  Bin time series data by an interval, according to a statistic.

Options:
  --outdir TEXT           Output directory
  --statistic [mean|sum]  Statistic for aggregating data  [default: mean]
  --interval INTEGER      Interval in number of time steps for aggregating
                          data  [default: 1]
  --zip                   Use zlib compression of data and coordinate
                          variables
```

Example:
`> trefoil bin_ts input.nc in_var --interval 10`

Assuming input.nc has a 3rd dimension 50 steps long, this will create a new
dataset called `input_bin.nc` in the same directory, with 5 steps, each of which
will have the average (by default) of the values for `in_var` for each 10 step
interval of the input.

## Calculate delta

_experimental, subject to change_

`delta` will calculate the delta as either a difference or proportion for each
input file (for each time period, if they have a temporal dimension).

```
> trefoil delta --help

Usage: trefoil delta [OPTIONS] BASELINE FILES VARIABLE

Options:
  --bidx INTEGER  Index in baseline if 3D (default 0)
  --proportion    Use proportion instead of difference
  --outdir TEXT   Output directory
```

## Describe a NetCDF file

`describe` will produce a structured output describing attributes, dimensions,
and variables in this dataset, along with information about spatial and temporal
extents if they can be determined.

Example:
`> trefoil describe input.nc`

## Extract variables into new files

_due for an overhaul, best to avoid using this for now_

## Create a mask from a shapefile

`mask` will create a NetCDF file with a binary mask created from features in a
shapefile. Currently uses a template NetCDF file to determine the geospatial
dimensions and projection against which to rasterize the shapefile.

This is typically used to mask in areas within an area of interest, and mask out
areas that are outside.

```
> trefoil mask --help

Usage: trefoil mask [OPTIONS] INPUT OUTPUT

  Create a NetCDF mask from a shapefile.

  Values are equivalent to a numpy mask: 0 for unmasked areas, and 1 for
  masked areas.

  Template NetCDF dataset must have a valid projection defined or be
  inferred from dimensions (e.g., lat / long)

Options:
  --variable TEXT  Name of output mask variable
  --like PATH      Template NetCDF dataset  [required]
  --netcdf3        Output in NetCDF3 version instead of NetCDF4
  --all-touched    Turn all touched pixels into mask (otherwise only pixels
                   with centroid in features)
  --zip            Use zlib compression of data and coordinate variables
```

Example:
`> trefoil mask my_shapefile.shp mask.nc --like template.nc --all-touched`

Will produce a mask that is `False` in all pixels covered by the shapefile's
features, and `True` everywhere else.

## Rendering a NetCDF variable to images

_options subject to change without notice_

`render_netcdf` renders a variable into PNG files. Several options are available
to control the output.

One interesting usage is with the `--map` option, which opens a Leaflet-based
map viewer in your browser with the images from this file spatially anchored
over the map.

```
> trefoil render_netcdf --help

Usage: trefoil render_netcdf [OPTIONS] FILENAME_PATTERN VARIABLE
                            OUTPUT_DIRECTORY

  Render netcdf files to images.

  colormap is ignored if renderer_file is provided

  --dst-crs is ignored if using --map option (always uses EPSG:3857

  If no colormap or palette is provided, a default palette may be chosen
  based on the name of the variable.

  If provided, mask must be 1 for areas to be masked out, and 0 otherwise.
  It must be in the same CRS as the input datasets, and have the same spatial
  dimensions.

                                  as first dimension of variable (example:
                                  time).  Guessed from the 3rd dimension
  --lh INTEGER                    Height of the legend in pixels [default:

                                  unless otherwise provided
```

Example:
`> trefoil render_netcdf inputs_*.nc in_var img --colormap min:#00F,max:#F00`

Will render each time slice of each of the inputs to an image, using a blue to
red stretched renderer (in HSV color space, by default), stretched from the
minimum to the maximum values across all datasets.

## Render a NetCDF-based EEMS model to a map

`map_eems` creates a Leaflet-based web map of a NetCDF-based EEMS model.  
It uses blue-yellow-red color ramp for data variables in fuzzy space, and a
black to white color ramp for input data variables.

Note: the same resampling method applies to all variables, and may not be
appropriate for all variables. Use `nearest` if any variables are categorical.

```
> trefoil map_eems --help
Usage: trefoil map_eems [OPTIONS] EEMS_FILE

  Render a NetCDF EEMS model to a web map.

Options:
  --scale FLOAT                   Scale factor for data pixel to screen pixel
                                  size
  --format [png|jpg|webp]         [default: png]
  --src-crs, --src_crs TEXT       Source coordinate reference system (limited
                                  to EPSG codes, e.g., EPSG:4326).  Will be
                                  read from file if not provided.
  --resampling [nearest|cubic|lanczos|mode]
                                  Resampling method for reprojection (default:
                                  nearest
```

## Render a GeoTIFF

_likely to go away or be refactored in a major way_

## Set CRS information for NetCDF variables

`set_crs` sets coordinate reference (CRS) information for one or more 
variables in a dataset.

```
> trefoil set_crs --help
Usage: trefoil set_crs [OPTIONS] FILENAME PROJ4

Options:
--only TEXT  Set CRS only for the specified variables
--help       Show this message and exit.
```

## Display statistics for NetCDF variables

`stats` displays simple statistics (min, max, average) for variables across
a series of files.

Variables can be input as a comma-delimited list.

Can be optionally masked.

```
> trefoil stats --help

Usage: trefoil stats [OPTIONS] FILES VARIABLES

  Calculate statistics for each variable across all files

Options:
  --mask TEXT  Mask dataset:variable (e.g., mask.nc:mask).  Mask variable
               assumed to be named "mask" unless otherwise provided
```

Example:
`> trefoil stats input.nc in_var1,in_var2`

## Convert rasters to NetCDF

`to_netcdf` will convert from any raster that can be read with `rasterio`
into a NetCDF file with appropriate geospatial dimensions, and optional
temporal dimension. It will automatically infer data type and coordinate
reference system, if possible. It currently uses the Python
[strptime](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior)
format for parsing dates, but limited to 2 and 4 digit years only (`%Y` and `%y`).

A common use case is to convert a series of ArcASCII files into a NetCDF
file with geospatial and temporal dimensions.

```
> trefoil to_netcdf --help

Usage: trefoil to_netcdf [OPTIONS] FILES OUTPUT VARIABLE

  Convert rasters to NetCDF and stack them according to a dimension.

  X and Y dimension names will be named according to the source projection
  (lon, lat if geographic projection, x, y otherwise) unless specified.

  Will overwrite an existing NetCDF file.

  Only the first band of the input will be turned into a NetCDF file.

Options:
  --dtype [float32|float64|int8|int16|int32|uint8|uint16|uint32]
                                  Data type of output variable.  Will be
                                  inferred from input raster if not provided.
  --src-crs TEXT                  Source coordinate reference system (limited
                                  to EPSG codes, e.g., EPSG:4326).  Will be
                                  read from file if not provided.
  --x TEXT                        Name of x dimension and variable (default:
                                  lon or x)
  --y TEXT                        Name of y dimension and variable (default:
                                  lat or y)
  --z TEXT                        Name of z dimension and variable  [default:
                                  time]
  --netcdf3                       Output in NetCDF3 version instead of NetCDF4
  --zip                           Use zlib compression of data and coordinate
                                  variables
  --packed                        Pack floating point values into an integer
                                  (will lose precision)
  --xy-dtype [float32|float64]    Data type of spatial coordinate variables.
                                  [default: float32]
  --calendar TEXT                 Calendar to use if z dimension is a date
                                  type  [default: standard]
  --autocrop                      Automatically crop to data bounds (trim
                                  NODATA)
```

Example:
`> trefoil to_netcdf "inputs_*.asc" output.nc my_var --dtype uint8 --src-crs EPSG:4326`

Will produce a NetCDF file with longitude and latitude dimensions, and a Z
dimension that is of the same size as the number of files that meet the filename
pattern. Files are stacked in the order they are listed in the directory
(alphabetically). The data variable `my_var` will contain the data read from
the ArcASCII files, converted to unsigned 8 bit integers.

`> trefoil to_netcdf inputs_%Y.asc output.nc my_var --dtype uint8 --src-crs EPSG:4326`

Will produce a similar output, but will use the `%Y` expression to match 4 digit
years and add those to a temporal dimension and coordinate variable, stored
according to CF conventions (in days since the first year of the series, based
on the input calendar).

## List variables in a NetCDF file

`variables` lists the data and coordinate variables within the NetCDF dataset.

Example:
`> trefoil variables input.nc`

## Reproject a variable in a NetCDF file

`warp` will reproject one or more data variables in a NetCDF file to a new
coordinate reference system, using a template dataset to establish the
geospatial domain for output. Files will be given the same name as the inputs
in the output directory.

```
> trefoil warp --help

Usage: trefoil warp [OPTIONS] FILENAME_PATTERN OUTPUT_DIRECTORY

Options:
  --variables TEXT                comma-delimited list of variables to warp.
                                  Default: all data variables
  --src-crs TEXT                  Source Coordinate Reference System (only
                                  used if none found in source dataset)
                                  [default: EPSG:4326]
  --like PATH                     Template dataset  [required]
  --resampling [nearest|cubic|lanczos|mode]
                                  Resampling method for reprojection
                                  [default: nearest]
```

Example:
`> trefoil warp input_geographic.nc output --like template_mercator.nc`

## Calculate zonal statistics on a series of NetCDF files

`zonal_stats` will use zones created by the `zones` command to create zonal
statistics for a one or more variables in one or more NetCDF files.

```
> trefoil zonal_stats --help
Usage: trefoil zonal_stats [OPTIONS] ZONES FILENAME_PATTERN OUTPUT

  Calculate zonal statistics for a series of NetCDF files.

  Zones must be created using the 'zones' command.

  The output file can either be a CSV (recommended) or JSON format file,
  which is automatically determined from the file extension of the output
  filename.

  See docs/cli.md for more information about output format.

Options:
  --variables TEXT      Comma-separated list of variables (if not provided,
                        will use all data variables)
  --statistics TEXT     Comma-separated list of statistics (available:
                        mean,min,max,std,sum,count)  [default: mean]
  --zone_variable TEXT  Name of output zones variable  [default: zone]
```

CSV output has the following header:

`filename, variable, <3rd dimension name, if 3D>, zone, <statistic_1>, ... <statistic_N>`

JSON output is a nested data structure, that varies in depth based on
presence of a 3rd dimension.

2 dimensions:

```
{
    "filename": {
        "variable": {
            "zone": {
                "statistic": value
            }
        }
    }
}
```

3 dimensions:

```
{
    "filename": {
        "variable": {
            "3rd dimension value": {
                "zone": {
                    "statistic": value
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Create zones based on features

`zones` creates zones in a NetCDF file using features from a shapefile and
a template raster to determine the spatial context.

Currently zones are represented as a single, 2D variable. This means that
assignment of pixels (esp. large pixels) to features is determined by
GDAL's internal algorithms, and does not make this determination based on the
maximum area of overlap (as is done in other GIS platforms). We recommend
caution and inspection of outputs when using this for small features and large
pixels.

Note: because a values lookup is used to control the output data type, and allow
use of string attributes for zones, the data in the zone variable is simply
an integer lookup. Do not expect to pull this into a GIS and compare values
to the original features.

```
> trefoil zones --help
Usage: trefoil zones [OPTIONS] INPUT OUTPUT

  Create zones in a NetCDF from features in a shapefile.  This is intended
  to be used as input to zonal statistics functions; it is not intended as a
  direct replacement for rasterizing geometries into NetCDF.

  Only handles < 65,535 features for now.

  If --attribute is provided, any features that do not have this will not be
  assigned to zones.

  A values lookup will be used to store values.  The zones are indices of
  the unique values encountered when extracting features. The original values
  are stored in an additional variable with the name of the zones variable
  plus '_values'.

  Template NetCDF dataset must have a valid projection defined or be
  inferred from dimensions (e.g., lat / long).

Options:
  --variable TEXT   Name of output zones variable  [default: zone]
  --attribute TEXT  Name of attribute in shapefile to use for zones (default:
                    feature ID)
  --like PATH       Template NetCDF dataset  [required]
  --netcdf3         Output in NetCDF3 version instead of NetCDF4
  --zip             Use zlib compression of data and coordinate variables
```

Example:
`> trefoil zones --like trefoil/test_data/tmin.nc trefoil/test_data/tmin_zones/tmin_zones.shp zones.nc`
